  1. Students can improve their listening skills by listening to a story narrated with accurate pronunciation by AI.

- Group activities 
 
- Required Tools 💻
  * Hugging Face
  * Colab

- Contents 💬
1. The teacher explains the story to the students.
   * Students understand the story through videos.
   * The story video was pre-made by the teacher using a tool called 'Steve I'.
2. After watching the video, students are provided with the summary text.
3. Students summarize the overall story in four sentences
   * Without using the provided sentences in text.
   * Write down a sentence that you've come up with yourself. 
   * Using ChatGPT to create sentences is also fine.
4. Students use Hugging Face to generate four images based on the four sentences.
5. The four images generated are exchanged among groups of students to arrange them in the correct sequence.
   * We plan to use Google Colab for coding for this activity (not yet finalized).
